This is a homepage I created to promote the clothing line featured on the main website by compiling a list of items that I think fit with contemporary men's and women's fashion.
Therefore, clothings on Jein, my website would list products from shein, and have a hyperlink to where they can purchase the said product.

The reason why i chose to do a clothing website is because it is something i use from day to day life as i am obsessed with shopping . Therefore , it being my biggest expendidure .
My main webpage, index.html, will not only display the current daily discounts for a few items of clothes, but it will also feature a brief video commercial highlighting. The clothings in the men's and women's sections is also chosen to complement the fashion of contemporary men and women.

First, I'll have navigation bars with options for users to browse to their app profiles and cart.
Users will also have the option of selecting the type of clothing they want to buy. For instance, the women's clothes department can include dresses and tops.
When a user chooses to add an item to their card, it directs them to the shein webpage for the next item.

I decided to use a white gif background as it suits the color of the shein webpage, white, which makes the webpage look clean and neat. Furthermore, i used black and white color as it enhances the visual appeal, revitalizes stale images, and provides the framework for your evaluation of the picture.
