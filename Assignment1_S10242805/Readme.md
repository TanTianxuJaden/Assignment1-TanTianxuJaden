This project of mine is a homepage I created to promote the clothing line featured on the main website, shein, by compiling a list of items that I think fit with contemporary men's and women's fashion. Therefore, clothings on Jein, my website would list products from shein, and have a hyperlink to where they can purchase the said product. 
The reason why i chose to do this is as this would promote the clothing company shein and also help user filter out what type of style suits modern women and men of any age.

I decided to use a white gif background with stars icon as it suits the color of the shein webpage, white, which makes the webpage look clean and neat. Furthermore, i used black and white color as it enhances the visual appeal, revitalizes stale images, and provides the framework for your evaluation of the picture. For the information section, i used the color wheat as it is comforting and clean to the users eyes. The main page would display discounted clothings on shein and clothings on sale, in the womens and mens section of clothings, it would display clothings from shein which i find appealing and suitable for modern day women and men. Under the ... icon of each clothing, they can see which sizes of said clothing is available on shein and the rating of this product.I have used the colour pink for the flash sale as it is bold and strikes out to the user on the listed clothings on sale.

My main webpage, index.html, will not only display the current daily discounts for a few items of clothes, but it will also feature a brief video commercial highlighting. The clothings in the men's and women's sections is also chosen to complement the fashion of contemporary men and women. Furthermore, I'll have navigation bars with options for users to browse to their app profiles and cart. Users will also have the option of selecting the type of clothing they want to buy. For instance, the women's clothes department can include dresses and tops. When a user chooses to add an item to their card, it directs them to the shein webpage for the next item.
