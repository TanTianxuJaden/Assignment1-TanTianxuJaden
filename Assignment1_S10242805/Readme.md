This project of mine is a webpage regarding selling clothing worldwide . 
This webpage sells clothings for both type of genders . 
The reason why i chose to do a clothing website is because it is something i use from day to day life as i am obsessed with shopping . Therefore , it being my biggest expendidure .
In my main webpage , it will not only show u the daily sales for selected clothing but also have a short video advertisement to show the top clothings with the highest sales.

Firstly , i will have the navigation bars which allow users to pick the option to go to their app profile , cart .
In addition , users will be able to choose which type of clothes they would like to purchase . For example , clothing , dresses and tops for the women section .
The buttons will be linked , such that it will bring them to another webpage.

I decided to use a white background instead as it illustrates simplicity as they are many elements on the webpage . Therefore , it would not look messy and draw the users attention to what matters most , the clothings.
